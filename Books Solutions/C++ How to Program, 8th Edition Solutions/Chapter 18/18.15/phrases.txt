a hot potato
a penny for your thoughts
actions speak louder than words
add insult to injury
an arm and a leg
at the drop of a hat
back to the drawing board
ball is in your court
barking up the wrong tree
be glad to see the back of
beat around the bush
best of both worlds
best thing since sliced bread
bite off more than you can chew
blessing in disguise
burn the midnight oil
can't judge a book by its cover
caught between two stools
costs an arm and a leg
cross that bridge when you come to it
cry over spilt milk
curiosity killed the cat
cut corners
cut the mustard [possibly derived from "cut the muster"]
devil's advocate
don't count your chickens before the eggs have hatched
don't give up the day job
don't put all your eggs in one basket
drastic times call for drastic measures
elvis has left the building
every cloud has a silver lining
far cry from
feel a bit under the weather
give the benefit of the doubt
hear it on the grapevine
hit the nail on the head
hit the sack / sheets / hay
in the heat of the moment
it takes two to tango
jump on the bandwagon
keep something at bay
kill two birds with one stone
last straw
let sleeping dogs lie
let the cat out of the bag
make a long story short
method to my madness
miss the boat
not a spark of decency
not playing with a full deck
off one's rocker
on the ball
once in a blue moon
picture paints a thousand words
piece of cake
put wool over other people's eyes
see eye to eye
sit on the fence
speak of the devil!
steal someone's thunder
take with a grain of salt
taste of your own medicine
to hear something straight from the horse's mouth
whole nine yards
wouldn't be caught dead
your guess is as good as mine
